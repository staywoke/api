Redis Configuration
===

#### Start / Stop

You need Redis running, which you can do if you've Brew-installed it like this:

```bash
brew services start redis
brew services stop redis
```

On Linux you can run in like this ( assuming you installed the service ):

```bash
sudo systemctl start redis
sudo systemctl stop redis
```
